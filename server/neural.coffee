# making a neural network
# one input nodes layer, with as many nodes as keys in the data objects
# one (or could go two, but mostly unnecessary) hidden layer, which should probably use leaky relu (any differentiable function to activate)
# hidden layer should have amount of nodes somewhere between input and output. More nodes is useful if doing pruning of nodes nearing 0 on each pass
# but too many nodes will just "memorise" the training set and not get anywhere with new unseen inputs
# one output nodes layer, which should have one node unless classifying things, in which case as many nodes as there are classes
# need to pass in the inputs, and run through many times (epochs)
# after each epoch, run back and rebalance assumptions
# once a network has been trained on a dataset, should work on new objects shown to it
# so the trained configuration could do with being stored (just needing to know the value of the nodes when it works)

# and remember the problem - will this be any better for finding if one image contains another?
# maybe not, but may be useful for other things anyway

# and for what I am probably doing (finding logos in pdfs) need to extract pdf to image first
# and probably best to throw out all text first if possible, or extract all images, rather than turning the whole doc into an image
# and if it would be possible to know how many pages to bother checking, that could reduce the search space
# e.g if no logo in the first few pages, it probably won't turn up on page 100

# pdf.js (which is used a bit in the old api code too) may be useful
